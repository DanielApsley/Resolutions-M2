# Resolutions-M2
Some stuff to compute resolutions in Macaulay2. It gives a presentation for general charts of a blowup in a rough way, but work:s quite well for computing strict tranfroms of blowups of affine r-space along linear subspaces. 

So far it can only handle one blowup at a time. Eventually we'd like to be able to perform blowups iteratively and to automate the embedded resolution of curves in smooth surfaces.

Next, we would like to implement log resolutions of curves and ideals in surfaces, and to output certain measures of singularities (like multiplier ideals). 

It would also be nice to implement other kinds of blowups and more general resolutions.
