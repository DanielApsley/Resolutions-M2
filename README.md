# Blowup-Affine-Charts-M2
Some stuff to compute blowups in Macaulay2. It gives a presentation for general charts of a blowup in a rough way, but works quite well for computing strict tranfroms of blowups of affine r-space along (x_1, ..., x_n). 

So far it can only handle one blowup at a time. Eventually I'd like to be able to perform blowups iteratively and to automate the embedded resolution of plane curves. It would be especially nice to keep track of exceptional curves, and to output a dual graph of a given curve singularity.
