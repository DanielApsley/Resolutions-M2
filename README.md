# Resolutions-M2

Some stuff to compute resolutions of singularities in Macaulay2. As is it nicely describes the affine charts of blowups of affine varieties. 

So far it can only handle one blowup at a time. Eventually we'd like to be able to perform blowups iteratively and to automate the embedded resolution of curves in smooth surfaces.

Next, we would like to implement log resolutions of curves and ideals in surfaces, and to output certain measures of singularities (like multiplier ideals). 

It would also be nice to implement other kinds of blowups and more general resolutions.
